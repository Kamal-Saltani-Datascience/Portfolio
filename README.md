About Me

I am a passionate data scientist with experience in machine learning, data analysis, and visualization. I specialize in using Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn, and I am keenly interested in deep learning with TensorFlow and Keras. My projects reflect my ability to solve real-world problems using data-driven approaches.
