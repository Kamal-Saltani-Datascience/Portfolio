# Introduction.

Probability distributions are employed in predictive and prescriptive models to model uncertainty and inform decision-making by capturing each possible value's relative likelihood or frequency within a given range.

The two main types to create probability distributions:

•	Empirical Distributions: These are based on collected experts' assessments, historical data, or data generated from observations. They reflect the actual distribution of the data as observed in practice.

•	Standard Probability Distributions refer to theoretical models of empirical distributions with well-defined statistical properties. Examples include the normal distribution, binomial distribution, and Poisson distribution. These distributions serve as foundational models in statistical analysis and probability theory. They provide a framework for understanding the behavior of random variables and enable the calculation of probabilities and critical values and also can be applied in small to accurately model various real-world phenomena.
Employing these distributions in models helps capture the underlying uncertainty and variability in data, allowing for more informed and reliable decision-making.


# Scenario:

Consider a construction manager who oversees a team of workers. The daily workload includes managing tasks for 20 workers per day. Unfortunately, due to absenteeism, about 20% of workers fail to show up for work, leading to project delays and increased costs for the construction company.

Objective:  

- Find the ideal number of workers the manager should schedule daily to ensure the project stays on track, assuming only 80% of the planned workers show up.

- Use Python to intuitively calculate how many workers the construction manager should schedule to ensure that, on average, 20 workers are available daily.
